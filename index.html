	<p align="justify">I am currently a PhD student at the <a href="https://taur.cs.utexas.edu/">Text Analysis, Understanding, and Reasoning (TAUR)</a> group, at the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>, led by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/">Professor Greg Durrett</a>.</p>

	<p align="justify"> Previously, I was an Associate Research Engineer with the R&D team at Goldman Sachs for three years. This team was led by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yT1DBNsAAAAJ&hl=en">Vijay Saraswat</a>. I worked on open problems in the space of Document AI and Conversation Understanding specific to the field of Finance.</p>

	<p align="justify">I completed my Master's in Computer Science from <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a> where I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/">Professor Mark Dredze</a> in an intersection of NLP and Regulatory Document Understanding. I did my undergrad from <a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/">IIIT-Delhi</a> where I majored in Computer Science. </p>

	<p align = "justify"> Beyond the research world, I like to volunteer my free time and work with non-profit organizations. I have previously volunteered with <a href="https://icaad.ngo/">ICAAD</a>, <a href="https://www.newyorkcares.org/">New York Cares</a> and am an active member of <a href="http://wimlds.org/">Women in Machine Learning and Data Science</a>. I also like to travel (contigent on visa haha) and consider myself an amateur photographer! During quarantine I actively started following Formula 1 and am passionately cheering for Ferrari in 2022 (those who are following will know this might be lost cause)!</p>
