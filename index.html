<p align="justify">About me : I'm Manya, and this is my first attempt to create a website/maintaining a website for my professional work, and some of my personal work too. Looking forward to building this space bit by bit to get in proper shape! </p>

<p align="justify"> I am currently a Research Engineer in the CoreAI team at Goldman Sachs. My work mostly revolves around natural language understanding, text extraction and entity linking. </p>

<p align = "justify">My personal interests however lie in trying to understand the use of technology, specifically NLP to build something useful in the space of Policy, Education, and Mental Health. :)) In the coming days, I'll try publish my work, readings, and interests in these domains.</p>

<p align="justify"> Personally, I am an amateur photographer, who is trying to develop on more hobbies during this quarantine!</p>
