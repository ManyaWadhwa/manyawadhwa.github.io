	<p align="justify">I am currently a PhD student at the <a href="https://taur.cs.utexas.edu/">Text Analysis, Understanding, and Reasoning (TAUR)</a> group, at the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>, led by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/">Professor Greg Durrett</a>.</p>

	<p align="justify"> Previously, I was an Associate Research Engineer with the R&D team at Goldman Sachs for three years. This team was led by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yT1DBNsAAAAJ&hl=en">Vijay Saraswat</a> and I also had the opportunity to work with great mentors like <a href="https://www.hoffart.ai/"> Johannes Hoffart</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=en&user=vJfDxrIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate"> Luciano Del Corro</a> . My work involved using Natural Language Understanding techniques in the space of Finance. We focused mostly on Financial and Regulation Document Understanding. I also dabbled a little in Dialogue Understanding specific to the financial domain. There were a range of NLP tasks I worked on - Information Extraction, Entity Linking, Question Answering and Slot Filling. </p>

	<p align="justify">I did my Master's from <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a> where I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/">Professor Mark Dredze</a> on an intersection on NLP and Public Health. </p>
	<p align="justify">I did my undergrad from <a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/">IIIT-Delhi</a> where I majored in Computer Science. </p>


	<p align = "justify"> Beyond the research world, I like to volunteer my free time and work with non-profit organizations. I have previously volunteered with <a href="https://icaad.ngo/">ICAAD</a>, <a href="https://www.newyorkcares.org/">New York Cares</a> and am an active member of <a href="http://wimlds.org/">Women in Machine Learning and Data Science</a>. I also like to travel (contigent on visa haha) and consider myself an amateur photographer! During quarantine I also started actively following Formula 1 and passionately cheering for Ferrari this season (this might be lost cause though)!</p>
