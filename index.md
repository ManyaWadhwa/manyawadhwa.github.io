### A bit about me ..

I'm Manya, and this is my first attempt to create a website/maintaining a website for my professional work, and some of my personal work too. Looking forward to building this space bit by bit to get in proper shape!

I am currently a Research Engineer in the CoreAI team at Goldman Sachs. My work mostly revolves around natural language understanding, text extraction and entity linking.

My personal interests however lie trying to understand the use of technology, specifically NLP to build something useful in the space of policy understanding, education, and mental health. :)) In coming days, I'll try publish my work, readings, and interests in these domains to this space.

Personally, I am an amateur photographer, who is trying to develop on more hobbies during this quarantine!
