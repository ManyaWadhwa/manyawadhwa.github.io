## 1st August 2020

Sometimes I like to read blogs which are more focused towards the philosophy aspect of NLP - more like where is this community headed and what needs to be done in order to make things work and see if I agree/disagree with these things - also I think it makes me a better researcher in terms of getting to know a wider range of opinions, instead of just sticking with the knowledge. I personally believe that it is very important to know where this knowledge is headed or where it'll be progressing towards as well.

Today I read the blog "NLP beyond English"[this](https://ruder.io/nlp-beyond-english/) blog by Sebastian Ruder, and I am listing down my main takeaways from his blog.

* I personally think that the problem he expressed, which is that of, deep learning models only heading in the direction of English, or rather NN only heading in the direction of English, is very very relevant.

* Quoting directly from his blog :

```
A continuing lack of technological inclusion will not only exacerbate the language divide but it may also drive speakers of unsupported languages and dialects to high-resource languages with better technological support, further endangering such language varieties. To ensure that non-English language speakers are not left behind and at the same time to offset the existing imbalance, to lower language and literacy barriers, we need to apply our models to non-English languages.
```

* I think the above point is something i have thought of many times myself. Being from India, my parents speak in this dialect which is a form of one of the regional languages called *Punjabi*, the dialect in itself is called *Bhavalpuri*. I haven't expressed this concern to many people - but to me, I feel the language will eventually die off after my parents. None of my cousins or siblings ever learnt the language because of how the society was/is progressing. There is a so called "standardization" that came with the time - for India it was because of colonialism, and for the rest of the world, It is happening now, with other regions  being effected is cause of technology.

* From a very machine learning perspective, the NLP community has been working towards resources and methods that work well for English or high resource languages in general. A lot of the practices for these languages DO NOT work well or generalize to other languages. Some examples in the blog include - morphology  of language, reduplication which performs poorly  on languages with reduplication, languages with larger vocabularies.

* Quote from the blog which I found very true :

```
In the process, as a community we have overfit to the characteristics and conditions of English-language data. In particular, by focusing on high-resource languages, we have prioritised methods that work well only when large amounts of labelled and unlabelled data are available.
```

* From a common sense perspective, concepts of common sense are different for different cultures.

* Quoting from the blog :

```
As an NLP researcher or practitioner, we have to ask ourselves whether we want our NLP system to exclusively share the values of a specific country or language community.
```

* All in all, from a research standpoint I think the blog is very very very inspiring. Like, I myself would love to work on some low-resource languages from India, but I'm not sure how well that would translate to an industry application. It always for quite some time will go hand in hand with academic research. OR maybe - it has applications like regional language news, translation, or just the historical linguistic perspective of saving certain linguistics variety. It might be a little sad to see the world which has SO much variety right now converge to a point of 10 popular languages for which we were able to make chat bots! ( can't even )
