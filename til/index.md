With the huge amount of information that is being published and put on the internet these days, I get very overwhelmed. To keep track, I end up journaling my "learnings" from papers/courses/blogs etc. Helps me track my progress. From now on, I'll document them here! It'll be a list of my TILs :)) I will journal these on my end throughout the week, and will post them out on the weekends!

I realize my TIL pages haven't been updated in a couple of months, I have just been a little busy with work ( a little bit of an excuse ) - good part being that Im learning at my end - just haven't had the time to document it. Hopefully I'll be able to post bulk updates for the month of September, and be more regular for the month of October.

I have been following some latest work in EMNLP, and attending sessions from [NLP with Friends](https://nlpwithfriends.com/) and [AI for Social Impact seminars](https://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/ai-social-impact)
