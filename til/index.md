With the huge amount of information that is being published and put on the internet these days, I get very overwhelmed. To keep track, I end up journaling my "learnings" from papers/courses/blogs etc. Helps me track my progress. From now on, I'll document them here! It'll be a list of my TILs :)) I will journal these on my end throughout the week, and will post them out on the weekends!

* [August 2020](august_2020.md) 
* [July 2020](july_2020.md) - Mostly ACL for the first week!
* [June 2020](june_2020.md) - AKBC and some other papers!s
