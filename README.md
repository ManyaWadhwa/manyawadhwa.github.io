## About me

I'm Manya, and this is my first attempt to create a website/maintaining a website for my professional work, and some of my personal work too. Looking forward to building this space bit by bit to get in proper shape! 

A little bit about my work, I work as an NLP engineer in finance. Mostly on language understanding tasks. My personal interests however lie trying to understand the use of technology, specifically NLP to build something useful in the space of policy understanding, education, and mental health. :)) 

Personally, I am an amateur photographer, who is trying to develop on more hobbies during this quarantine. 

For more updates, stay tuned to this space!
