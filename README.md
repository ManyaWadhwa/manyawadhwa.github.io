## About me

I'm Manya, and this is my first attempt to create a website/maintaining a website for my professional work, and some of my personal work too. Looking forward to building this space bit by bit to get in proper shape!

I am currently working as an NLP engineer in finance. Most of my work revolves around document understanding from different perspectives - information extraction, entity linking, representation learning and concept learning.

My personal interests however lie in trying to understand the use of technology, specifically NLP to build something in the space of policy understanding, education, and mental health. :))

Personally, I am an amateur photographer, who is trying to develop on more hobbies during this quarantine.
