Concept C is a property of Concept B, which the person is supposed to guess. \nYou are trying create a query that elicits a connection between Concept A and Concept C, to see if the person being quizzed can guess concept B. \nYour goal is to create a natural, human-readable question.\nWhen needed, add a short descriptor to Concept A, especially when it is a niche entity.\n\nRules:\n1. Leverage concept B to determine how to phrase the query.  \neg: if concept B is a person, then formulate a query such that concept C is a property for a person. eg: \"someone for whom the election was a significant event\".\nsimilarly, if concept B is an organization, using \"an organization that has...\"\nif concept B is a chemical compound\/medicine then use \"a substance that is...\"\n2. For any concept C with a familial relation, i.e. child\/mother\/father, the concept should be interpreted as \" has child <entity3>\" or \"has mother <entity 3>\" or \"has father <entity3>\".   \n3. Do not reveal concept B in the query at all. \n4. Avoid overly formal or mechanical phrasing.\n5.

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Morton Gould'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'discography' and whose tail entity is 'Benny Carter discography'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Morton Gould'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON

Concept C is a property of Concept B, which the person is supposed to guess. \nYou are trying create a query that elicits a connection between Concept A and Concept C, to see if the person being quizzed can guess concept B. \nYour goal is to create a natural, human-readable question.\nWhen needed, add a short descriptor to Concept A, especially when it is a niche entity.\n\nRules:\n1. Leverage concept B to determine how to phrase the query.  \neg: if concept B is a person, then formulate a query such that concept C is a property for a person. eg: \"someone for whom the election was a significant event\".\nsimilarly, if concept B is an organization, using \"an organization that has...\"\nif concept B is a chemical compound\/medicine then use \"a substance that is...\"\n2. For any concept C with a familial relation, i.e. child\/mother\/father, the concept should be interpreted as \" has child <entity3>\" or \"has mother <entity 3>\" or \"has father <entity3>\".   \n3. Do not reveal concept B in the query at all. \n4. Avoid overly formal or mechanical phrasing.\n5.

Bela B, as a well\u2011known German musician, has appeared in many media outlets, but the set of interviewers (TV shows, magazines, podcasts) is likely smaller than the set of Anja Caspary\u2019s interviewees, perhaps on the order of 20.

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible.

No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Joe Spinell'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Joe Spinell'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'place of birth' and whose tail entity is 'Brooklyn'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Joe Spinell'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"all_response_tokens":[2591.0],"all_reasoning_tokens":[2591.0],"raw_path_prediction":["<think>\n\n<\/think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"co-starred with\",

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Mick Thomson'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'occupation' and whose tail entity is 'percussionist'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Mick Thomson'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","path_prediction":["<think>\n\n<\/think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Mick Thomson\", \"member

different ways of connecting Mick Thomson, the guitarist known for his work in heavy metal, and someone who is a percussionist by occupation?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Mick Thomson'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'occupation' and whose tail entity is 'percussionist'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Mick Thomson'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"all_response_tokens":[1881.0],"all_reasoning_tokens":[1881.0],"raw_path_prediction":["<think>\n\n<\/think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Mick Thomson\", \"member of\",

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible.

Both Ninoy Aquino and Jovito Salonga were members of the Upsilon Sigma Phi fraternity, making the 'fraternity brother' connection accurate.

Ferdinand Marcos was President of the Philippines and never served as defense minister; Juan Ponce Enrile held that post under Marcos. The relationship is therefore inaccurate.

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Boutros Boutros-Ghali'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'occupation' and whose tail entity is 'poet'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Boutros Boutros-Ghali'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","path_prediction":["<think>\n\n<\/think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\n      \"Boutros Boutros-Ghali\",\n      \"position held\",\n      \"Secretary-General of the United Nations\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"Secretary-General of the United Nations\",\n      \"successor\",\n      \"Kofi Annan\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"Kofi Annan\",\n      \"spouse\",\n      \"Nane Annan\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"Nane Annan\",\n      \"uncle\",\n      \"Raoul Wallenberg\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"Raoul Wallenberg\",\n      \"commemorated in\",\n      \"Raoul Wallenberg (poem)\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"Raoul Wallenberg (poem)\",\n      \"author\",\n      \"W.

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Boutros Boutros-Ghali'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'occupation' and whose tail entity is 'poet'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Boutros Boutros-Ghali'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"all_response_tokens":[2614.0],"all_reasoning_tokens":[2614.0],"raw_path_prediction":["<think>\n\n<\/think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\n      \"Boutros Boutros-Ghali\",\n      \"position held\",\n      \"Secretary-General of the United Nations\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"Secretary-General of the United Nations\",\n      \"successor\",\n      \"Kofi Annan\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"Kofi Annan\",\n      \"spouse\",\n      \"Nane Annan\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"Nane Annan\",\n      \"uncle\",\n      \"Raoul Wallenberg\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"Raoul Wallenberg\",\n      \"commemorated in\",\n      \"Raoul Wallenberg (poem)\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"Raoul Wallenberg (poem)\",\n      \"author\",\n      \"W.

Concept C is a property of Concept B, which the person is supposed to guess. \nYou are trying create a query that elicits a connection between Concept A and Concept C, to see if the person being quizzed can guess concept B. \nYour goal is to create a natural, human-readable question.\nWhen needed, add a short descriptor to Concept A, especially when it is a niche entity.\n\nRules:\n1. Leverage concept B to determine how to phrase the query.  \neg: if concept B is a person, then formulate a query such that concept C is a property for a person. eg: \"someone for whom the election was a significant event\".\nsimilarly, if concept B is an organization, using \"an organization that has...\"\nif concept B is a chemical compound\/medicine then use \"a substance that is...\"\n2. For any concept C with a familial relation, i.e. child\/mother\/father, the concept should be interpreted as \" has child <entity3>\" or \"has mother <entity 3>\" or \"has father <entity3>\".   \n3. Do not reveal concept B in the query at all. \n4. Avoid overly formal or mechanical phrasing.\n5. Do not connect concept A and C directly in the wording. \n\n---- EXAMPLES ----\nExample 1:\nConcept A: Vishwanath Pratap Singh\nConcept B: Narendra Modi (person)\nConcept C: (significant event, Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for Indian general election, 2014)   \nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Vishwanath Pratap Singh and someone for whom the BJP campaign for the 2014 Indian general election, was a significant event? \n\nExample 2: \nConcept A: Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\nConcept B: Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar (person)\nConcept C: (position held, President of the Council of Ministers of Peru) \nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, and someone who is\/has been the President of the council of ministers of Peru? \n \n Example 3: \nConcept A: Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen\nConcept B: Sebastian Vettel (person)\nConcept C: ('member of sports team', 'Red Bull Racing')\n\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Kimi Raikkonen, the Finnish racing driver and a sports person who was\/is a part of the Red Bull Racing team?\n\nExample 4: \nConcept A: Jim Broadbent\nConcept B: Saoirse Ronan (person)\nConcept C: (nominated for, Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress)\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Jim Broadbent, English actor, and someone who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress?\n\nExample 5:\nConcept A: oxymetholone\nConcept B: sodium ascorbate (substance)\nConcept C: stereoisomer of, sodium erythorbate\n\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting oxymetholone, a chemical compound and a substance that is a stereoisomer of sodium erythorbate\n\nExample 6:\nConcept A: Christopher Nolan\nConcept B: Emma Thomas (person)\nConcept C: (child, Rory Nolan)\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Christopher Nolan, the actor, and someone who is the parent of Rory Nolan? \n \n---- TASK ---- \n\nConcept A: chlorpromazine\nConcept B: metocurine iodide (substance)\nConcept C: (metocurine iodide,Cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit,physically interacts with)\n\nQuery:\n","query":"What are different ways of connecting chlorpromazine, a medication used to treat various mental health conditions, and a substance that physically interacts with the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit?","entity_a":"chlorpromazine","entity_b":"Cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit","rel_b":"physically interacts with","index":19,"prompt":"Query: What are different ways of connecting chlorpromazine, a medication used to treat various mental health conditions, and a substance that physically interacts with the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths.
