Concept C is a property of Concept B, which the person is supposed to guess. \nYou are trying create a query that elicits a connection between Concept A and Concept C, to see if the person being quizzed can guess concept B. \nYour goal is to create a natural, human-readable question.\nWhen needed, add a short descriptor to Concept A, especially when it is a niche entity.\n\nRules:\n1. Leverage concept B to determine how to phrase the query.  \neg: if concept B is a person, then formulate a query such that concept C is a property for a person. eg: \"someone for whom the election was a significant event\".\nsimilarly, if concept B is an organization, using \"an organization that has...\"\nif concept B is a chemical compound\/medicine then use \"a substance that is...\"\n2. For any concept C with a familial relation, i.e. child\/mother\/father, the concept should be interpreted as \" has child <entity3>\" or \"has mother <entity 3>\" or \"has father <entity3>\".   \n3. Do not reveal concept B in the query at all. \n4. Avoid overly formal or mechanical phrasing.\n5. Do not connect concept A and C directly in the wording. \n\n---- EXAMPLES ----\nExample 1:\nConcept A: Vishwanath Pratap Singh\nConcept B: Narendra Modi (person)\nConcept C: (significant event, Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for Indian general election, 2014)   \nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Vishwanath Pratap Singh and someone for whom the BJP campaign for the 2014 Indian general election, was a significant event? \n\nExample 2: \nConcept A: Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\nConcept B: Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar (person)\nConcept C: (position held, President of the Council of Ministers of Peru) \nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, and someone who is\/has been the President of the council of ministers of Peru? \n \n Example 3: \nConcept A: Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen\nConcept B: Sebastian Vettel (person)\nConcept C: ('member of sports team', 'Red Bull Racing')\n\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Kimi Raikkonen, the Finnish racing driver and a sports person who was\/is a part of the Red Bull Racing team?\n\nExample 4: \nConcept A: Jim Broadbent\nConcept B: Saoirse Ronan (person)\nConcept C: (nominated for, Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress)\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Jim Broadbent, English actor, and someone who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress?\n\nExample 5:\nConcept A: oxymetholone\nConcept B: sodium ascorbate (substance)\nConcept C: stereoisomer of, sodium erythorbate\n\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting oxymetholone, a chemical compound and a substance that is a stereoisomer of sodium erythorbate\n\nExample 6:\nConcept A: Christopher Nolan\nConcept B: Emma Thomas (person)\nConcept C: (child, Rory Nolan)\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Christopher Nolan, the actor, and someone who is the parent of Rory Nolan? \n \n---- TASK ---- \n\nConcept A: Morton Gould\nConcept B: Benny Carter (person)\nConcept C: (Benny Carter,Benny Carter discography,discography)\n\nQuery:\n","query":"What are different ways of connecting Morton Gould, the American composer and conductor, and someone who has a notable discography in the music industry?","entity_a":"Morton Gould","entity_b":"Benny Carter discography","rel_b":"discography","index":0,"prompt":"Query: What are different ways of connecting Morton Gould, the American composer and conductor, and someone who has a notable discography in the music industry?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths.

end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"usage":null,"__index_level_0__":1,"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Max von

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible.

Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'David Koechner'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'place of birth' and whose tail entity is 'Newport Beach'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.).

No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Bela B'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Bela B'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'unmarried partner' and whose tail entity is 'Anja Caspary'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Bela B'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"usage":[{"completion_tokens":15800,"prompt_tokens":743,"total_tokens":16543}],"__index_level_0__":1,"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Bela B\", \"member of\",

W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States, and someone who held the position of First Lady of the United States?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'George H. W. Bush'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'position held' and whose tail entity is 'First Lady of the United States'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'George H. W. Bush'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"usage":[{"completion_tokens":20636,"prompt_tokens":760,"total_tokens":21396}],"__index_level_0__":3,"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>{\"1\": [[\"George H.

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'INTS7'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'expressed in' and whose tail entity is 'gallbladder'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'INTS7'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","path_prediction":["<answer>{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"INTS7\", \"part of\", \"Integrator complex\"],\n

gallbladder?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'INTS7'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'expressed in' and whose tail entity is 'gallbladder'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'INTS7'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"usage":[{"completion_tokens":12845,"prompt_tokens":746,"total_tokens":13591}],"__index_level_0__":4,"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"INTS7\", \"part of\",

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Horace Belton'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'educated at' and whose tail entity is 'University of Pittsburgh'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Horace Belton'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON

No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Niall Horan'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"usage":[{"completion_tokens":14686,"prompt_tokens":742,"total_tokens":15428}],"__index_level_0__":4,"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>{\"1\": [[\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"], [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Harry Styles\"], [\"Harry Styles\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]], \"2\": [[\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"], [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Liam Payne\"], [\"Liam Payne\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]], \"3\": [[\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"], [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Louis Tomlinson\"], [\"Louis Tomlinson\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]], \"4\": [[\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"], [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Zayn Malik\"], [\"Zayn Malik\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]], \"5\": [[\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"], [\"One Direction\", \"signed to\", \"Syco Music\"], [\"Syco Music\", \"founder\", \"Simon Cowell\"], [\"Simon Cowell\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]], \"6\": [[\"Niall Horan\", \"participant in\", \"The X Factor (British series 7)\"], [\"The X Factor (British series 7)\", \"judge\", \"Simon Cowell\"], [\"Simon Cowell\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]], \"7\": [[\"Niall Horan\", \"participant in\", \"The X Factor (British series 7)\"], [\"The X Factor (British series 7)\", \"judge\", \"Cheryl\"], [\"Cheryl\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]], \"8\": [[\"Niall Horan\", \"participant in\", \"The X Factor (British series 7)\"], [\"The X Factor (British series 7)\", \"host\", \"Dermot O'Leary\"], [\"Dermot O'Leary\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]], \"9\": [[\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"], [\"One Direction\", \"songwriter\", \"Ed Sheeran\"], [\"Ed Sheeran\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]], \"10\": [[\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"], [\"One Direction\", \"songwriter\", \"Jamie Scott\"], [\"Jamie Scott\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]], \"11\": [[\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"], [\"One Direction\", \"songwriter\", \"Wayne Hector\"], [\"Wayne Hector\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]], \"12\": [[\"Niall Horan\", \"managed by\", \"Modest!

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Marlon Jackson'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'fandom' and whose tail entity is 'Michael Jackson fandom'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Marlon Jackson'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","path_prediction":["<answer>{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Marlon Jackson\", \"sibling\", \"Michael Jackson

and someone who has a dedicated fandom surrounding their work?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Marlon Jackson'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'fandom' and whose tail entity is 'Michael Jackson fandom'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Marlon Jackson'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"usage":[{"completion_tokens":18301,"prompt_tokens":745,"total_tokens":19046}],"__index_level_0__":5,"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Marlon Jackson\",

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Richard Mentor Johnson'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'candidacy in election' and whose tail entity is '2016 United States Senate election in California'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Richard Mentor Johnson'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON
