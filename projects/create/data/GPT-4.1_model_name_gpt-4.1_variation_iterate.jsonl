Concept C is a property of Concept B, which the person is supposed to guess. \nYou are trying create a query that elicits a connection between Concept A and Concept C, to see if the person being quizzed can guess concept B. \nYour goal is to create a natural, human-readable question.\nWhen needed, add a short descriptor to Concept A, especially when it is a niche entity.\n\nRules:\n1. Leverage concept B to determine how to phrase the query.  \neg: if concept B is a person, then formulate a query such that concept C is a property for a person. eg: \"someone for whom the election was a significant event\".\nsimilarly, if concept B is an organization, using \"an organization that has...\"\nif concept B is a chemical compound\/medicine then use \"a substance that is...\"\n2. For any concept C with a familial relation, i.e. child\/mother\/father, the concept should be interpreted as \" has child <entity3>\" or \"has mother <entity 3>\" or \"has father <entity3>\".   \n3. Do not reveal concept B in the query at all. \n4. Avoid overly formal or mechanical phrasing.\n5. Do not connect concept A and C directly in the wording. \n\n---- EXAMPLES ----\nExample 1:\nConcept A: Vishwanath Pratap Singh\nConcept B: Narendra Modi (person)\nConcept C: (significant event, Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for Indian general election, 2014)   \nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Vishwanath Pratap Singh and someone for whom the BJP campaign for the 2014 Indian general election, was a significant event? \n\nExample 2: \nConcept A: Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\nConcept B: Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar (person)\nConcept C: (position held, President of the Council of Ministers of Peru) \nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, and someone who is\/has been the President of the council of ministers of Peru? \n \n Example 3: \nConcept A: Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen\nConcept B: Sebastian Vettel (person)\nConcept C: ('member of sports team', 'Red Bull Racing')\n\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Kimi Raikkonen, the Finnish racing driver and a sports person who was\/is a part of the Red Bull Racing team?\n\nExample 4: \nConcept A: Jim Broadbent\nConcept B: Saoirse Ronan (person)\nConcept C: (nominated for, Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress)\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Jim Broadbent, English actor, and someone who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress?\n\nExample 5:\nConcept A: oxymetholone\nConcept B: sodium ascorbate (substance)\nConcept C: stereoisomer of, sodium erythorbate\n\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting oxymetholone, a chemical compound and a substance that is a stereoisomer of sodium erythorbate\n\nExample 6:\nConcept A: Christopher Nolan\nConcept B: Emma Thomas (person)\nConcept C: (child, Rory Nolan)\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Christopher Nolan, the actor, and someone who is the parent of Rory Nolan? \n \n---- TASK ---- \n\nConcept A: Morton Gould\nConcept B: Benny Carter (person)\nConcept C: (Benny Carter,Benny Carter discography,discography)\n\nQuery:\n","query":"What are different ways of connecting Morton Gould, the American composer and conductor, and someone who has a notable discography in the music industry?","entity_a":"Morton Gould","entity_b":"Benny Carter discography","rel_b":"discography","index":0,"prompt":[{"content":"Query: What are different ways of connecting Morton Gould, the American composer and conductor, and someone who has a notable discography in the music industry?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths.

Therefore this triple is hallucinated. The second triple states that \\\"documentary\\\" features Wynton Marsalis. Again, the subject is the generic term \\\"documentary\\\" rather than a particular documentary title, making the subject non\u2011identifiable. Hence this triple is also hallucinated.

The second triple states that the Thelonious Monk Institute Competition was won by Joshua Redman. This is accurate: Redman won the 1991 Thelonious Monk International Saxophone Competition, so the triple is correct. The third triple connects Joshua Redman to his own discography.

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Max von Laue'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'occupation' and whose tail entity is 'chemist'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Max von Laue'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Max von Laue\", \"acted as\", \"PhD examiner for\", \"Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\"],\n    [\"Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\", \"received\", \"Nobel Prize in Physics\"],\n    [\"Nobel Prize in Chemistry\", \"awarded to\", \"Hans Fischer\"],\n    [\"Hans Fischer\", \"occupation\", \"chemist\"]\n  ],\n  \"2\": [\n    [\"Max von Laue\", \"served on\", \"Kaiser Wilhelm Society\"],\n    [\"Kaiser Wilhelm Society\", \"member\", \"Clara Immerwahr\"],\n    [\"Clara Immerwahr\", \"occupation\", \"chemist\"]\n  ],\n  \"3\": [\n    [\"Max von Laue\", \"fellow of\", \"Royal Society\"],\n    [\"Royal Society\", \"fellow\", \"Ahmed Zewail\"],\n    [\"Ahmed Zewail\", \"occupation\", \"chemist\"]\n  ],\n  \"4\": [\n    [\"Max von Laue\", \"received\", \"Max Planck Medal\"],\n    [\"Max Planck Medal\", \"recipient\", \"Manfred Eigen\"],\n    [\"Manfred Eigen\", \"occupation\", \"chemist\"]\n  ],\n  \"5\": [\n    [\"Max von Laue\", \"subject of\", \"Laue diffraction\"],\n    [\"Laue diffraction\", \"applied in research by\", \"Ada Yonath\"],\n    [\"Ada Yonath\", \"occupation\", \"chemist\"]\n  ],\n  \"6\": [\n    [\"Max von Laue\", \"influenced\", \"William Lawrence Bragg\"],\n    [\"William Lawrence Bragg\", \"mentor to\", \"Max Perutz\"],\n    [\"Max Perutz\", \"occupation\", \"chemist\"]\n  ],\n  \"7\": [\n    [\"Max von Laue\", \"born in\", \"German Empire\"],\n    [\"German Empire\", \"birthplace of\", \"Robert Bunsen\"],\n    [\"Robert Bunsen\", \"occupation\", \"chemist\"]\n  ],\n  \"8\": [\n    [\"Max von Laue\", \"member of\", \"International Union of Pure and Applied Physics\"],\n    [\"International Union of Pure and Applied Physics\", \"collaborates with\", \"International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\"],\n    [\"International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\", \"member\", \"Jean-Marie Lehn\"],\n    [\"Jean-Marie Lehn\", \"occupation\", \"chemist\"]\n  ],\n  \"9\": [\n    [\"Max von Laue\", \"has namesake\", \"Laue crater\"],\n    [\"Laue crater\", \"named after\", \"Max von Laue\"],\n    [\"Laue crater\", \"namesake of\", \"Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff\"],\n    [\"Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff\", \"occupation\", \"chemist\"]\n  ],\n  \"10\": [\n    [\"Max von Laue\", \"associate of\", \"Lise Meitner\"],\n    [\"Lise Meitner\", \"collaborated with\", \"Otto Hahn\"],\n    [\"Otto Hahn\", \"occupation\", \"chemist\"]\n  ],\n  \"11\": [\n    [\"Max von Laue\", \"member of\", \"Prussian Academy of Sciences\"],\n    [\"Prussian Academy of Sciences\", \"member\", \"Heinrich Caro\"],\n    [\"Heinrich Caro\", \"occupation\", \"chemist\"]\n  ],\n  \"12\": [\n    [\"Max von Laue\", \"influenced\", \"Herbert A.

different ways of connecting David Koechner, the American actor and comedian, and someone who was born in Newport Beach?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'David Koechner'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'place of birth' and whose tail entity is 'Newport Beach'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'David Koechner'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"David Koechner\", \"co-starred in\", \"The

Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'David Koechner'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'place of birth' and whose tail entity is 'Newport Beach'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'David Koechner'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"David Koechner\", \"co-starred in\", \"Scouts

Concept C is a property of Concept B, which the person is supposed to guess. \nYou are trying create a query that elicits a connection between Concept A and Concept C, to see if the person being quizzed can guess concept B. \nYour goal is to create a natural, human-readable question.\nWhen needed, add a short descriptor to Concept A, especially when it is a niche entity.\n\nRules:\n1. Leverage concept B to determine how to phrase the query.  \neg: if concept B is a person, then formulate a query such that concept C is a property for a person. eg: \"someone for whom the election was a significant event\".\nsimilarly, if concept B is an organization, using \"an organization that has...\"\nif concept B is a chemical compound\/medicine then use \"a substance that is...\"\n2. For any concept C with a familial relation, i.e. child\/mother\/father, the concept should be interpreted as \" has child <entity3>\" or \"has mother <entity 3>\" or \"has father <entity3>\".   \n3.

Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Bela B'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'unmarried partner' and whose tail entity is 'Anja Caspary'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Bela B'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Bela B\", \"supporter of\", \"Pro Asyl\"],\n

Concept C is a property of Concept B, which the person is supposed to guess. \nYou are trying create a query that elicits a connection between Concept A and Concept C, to see if the person being quizzed can guess concept B. \nYour goal is to create a natural, human-readable question.\nWhen needed, add a short descriptor to Concept A, especially when it is a niche entity.\n\nRules:\n1. Leverage concept B to determine how to phrase the query.  \neg: if concept B is a person, then formulate a query such that concept C is a property for a person. eg: \"someone for whom the election was a significant event\".\nsimilarly, if concept B is an organization, using \"an organization that has...\"\nif concept B is a chemical compound\/medicine then use \"a substance that is...\"\n2. For any concept C with a familial relation, i.e. child\/mother\/father, the concept should be interpreted as \" has child <entity3>\" or \"has mother <entity 3>\" or \"has father <entity3>\".   \n3. Do not reveal concept B in the query at all. \n4. Avoid overly formal or mechanical phrasing.\n5. Do not connect concept A and C directly in the wording. \n\n---- EXAMPLES ----\nExample 1:\nConcept A: Vishwanath Pratap Singh\nConcept B: Narendra Modi (person)\nConcept C: (significant event, Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for Indian general election, 2014)   \nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Vishwanath Pratap Singh and someone for whom the BJP campaign for the 2014 Indian general election, was a significant event? \n\nExample 2: \nConcept A: Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\nConcept B: Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar (person)\nConcept C: (position held, President of the Council of Ministers of Peru) \nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, and someone who is\/has been the President of the council of ministers of Peru? \n \n Example 3: \nConcept A: Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen\nConcept B: Sebastian Vettel (person)\nConcept C: ('member of sports team', 'Red Bull Racing')\n\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Kimi Raikkonen, the Finnish racing driver and a sports person who was\/is a part of the Red Bull Racing team?\n\nExample 4: \nConcept A: Jim Broadbent\nConcept B: Saoirse Ronan (person)\nConcept C: (nominated for, Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress)\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Jim Broadbent, English actor, and someone who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress?\n\nExample 5:\nConcept A: oxymetholone\nConcept B: sodium ascorbate (substance)\nConcept C: stereoisomer of, sodium erythorbate\n\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting oxymetholone, a chemical compound and a substance that is a stereoisomer of sodium erythorbate\n\nExample 6:\nConcept A: Christopher Nolan\nConcept B: Emma Thomas (person)\nConcept C: (child, Rory Nolan)\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Christopher Nolan, the actor, and someone who is the parent of Rory Nolan? \n \n---- TASK ---- \n\nConcept A: Nicolas Chopin\nConcept B: Tekla Justyna Chopin (person)\nConcept C: (Tekla Justyna Chopin,Jakub Krzy\u017canowski,father)\n\nQuery:\n","query":"What are different ways of connecting Nicolas Chopin, and someone who is the father of Jakub Krzy\u017canowski?","entity_a":"Nicolas Chopin","entity_b":"Jakub Krzy\u017canowski","rel_b":"father","index":7,"prompt":[{"content":"Query: What are different ways of connecting Nicolas Chopin, and someone who is the father of Jakub Krzy\u017canowski?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths.

Bush, the 41st President of the United States, and someone who held the position of First Lady of the United States?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'George H. W. Bush'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'position held' and whose tail entity is 'First Lady of the United States'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'George H. W. Bush'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"George H.

W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States, and someone who held the position of First Lady of the United States?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'George H. W. Bush'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'position held' and whose tail entity is 'First Lady of the United States'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'George H. W. Bush'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"George H.

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Joe Spinell'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'place of birth' and whose tail entity is 'Brooklyn'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Joe Spinell'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"2\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"birth name\", \"Joseph Spagnuolo\"],\n    [\"Joseph Spagnuolo\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"3\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"portrayed\", \"Willie Cicci (The Godfather)\"],\n    [\"Willie Cicci (The Godfather)\", \"portrayed by\", \"Joe Spinell\"],\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"4\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"starred\", \"James Caan\"],\n    [\"James Caan\", \"place of birth\", \"Bronx\"],\n    [\"James Caan\", \"worked with\", \"Joe Spinell\"],\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"5\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"set in\", \"New York City\"],\n    [\"Brooklyn\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"]\n  ],\n  \"6\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Maniac\"],\n    [\"Maniac\", \"filmed in\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"7\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Rocky\"],\n    [\"Rocky\", \"starred\", \"Sylvester Stallone\"],\n    [\"Sylvester Stallone\", \"place of birth\", \"New York City\"],\n    [\"Brooklyn\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"]\n  ],\n  \"8\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather Part II\"],\n    [\"The Godfather Part II\", \"starred\", \"Al Pacino\"],\n    [\"Al Pacino\", \"place of birth\", \"East Harlem\"],\n    [\"East Harlem\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"],\n    [\"Brooklyn\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"]\n  ],\n  \"9\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Taxi Driver\"],\n    [\"Taxi Driver\", \"starred\", \"Harvey Keitel\"],\n    [\"Harvey Keitel\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"10\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"directed by\", \"Francis Ford Coppola\"],\n    [\"Francis Ford Coppola\", \"father\", \"Carmine Coppola\"],\n    [\"Carmine Coppola\", \"place of birth\", \"New York City\"],\n    [\"Brooklyn\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"]\n  ],\n  \"11\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Nighthawks\"],\n    [\"Nighthawks\", \"starred\", \"Lindsay Wagner\"],\n    [\"Lindsay Wagner\", \"place of birth\", \"Los Angeles\"],\n    [\"Nighthawks\", \"filmed in\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"12\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Seven-Ups\"],\n    [\"The Seven-Ups\", \"starred\", \"Roy Scheider\"],\n    [\"Roy Scheider\", \"place of birth\", \"Orange, New Jersey\"],\n    [\"The Seven-Ups\", \"filmed in\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"13\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"starred\", \"Richard S.

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Joe Spinell'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'place of birth' and whose tail entity is 'Brooklyn'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Joe Spinell'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"2\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"birth name\", \"Joseph Spagnuolo\"],\n    [\"Joseph Spagnuolo\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"3\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"portrayed\", \"Willie Cicci (The Godfather)\"],\n    [\"Willie Cicci (The Godfather)\", \"portrayed by\", \"Joe Spinell\"],\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"4\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"starred\", \"James Caan\"],\n    [\"James Caan\", \"place of birth\", \"Bronx\"],\n    [\"James Caan\", \"worked with\", \"Joe Spinell\"],\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"5\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"set in\", \"New York City\"],\n    [\"Brooklyn\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"]\n  ],\n  \"6\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Maniac\"],\n    [\"Maniac\", \"filmed in\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"7\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Rocky\"],\n    [\"Rocky\", \"starred\", \"Sylvester Stallone\"],\n    [\"Sylvester Stallone\", \"place of birth\", \"New York City\"],\n    [\"Brooklyn\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"]\n  ],\n  \"8\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather Part II\"],\n    [\"The Godfather Part II\", \"starred\", \"Al Pacino\"],\n    [\"Al Pacino\", \"place of birth\", \"East Harlem\"],\n    [\"East Harlem\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"],\n    [\"Brooklyn\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"]\n  ],\n  \"9\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Taxi Driver\"],\n    [\"Taxi Driver\", \"starred\", \"Harvey Keitel\"],\n    [\"Harvey Keitel\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"10\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"directed by\", \"Francis Ford Coppola\"],\n    [\"Francis Ford Coppola\", \"father\", \"Carmine Coppola\"],\n    [\"Carmine Coppola\", \"place of birth\", \"New York City\"],\n    [\"Brooklyn\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"]\n  ],\n  \"11\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Nighthawks\"],\n    [\"Nighthawks\", \"starred\", \"Lindsay Wagner\"],\n    [\"Lindsay Wagner\", \"place of birth\", \"Los Angeles\"],\n    [\"Nighthawks\", \"filmed in\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"12\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Seven-Ups\"],\n    [\"The Seven-Ups\", \"starred\", \"Roy Scheider\"],\n    [\"Roy Scheider\", \"place of birth\", \"Orange, New Jersey\"],\n    [\"The Seven-Ups\", \"filmed in\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"13\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"starred\", \"Richard S.

are different ways of connecting Joe Spinell, the American actor, and someone who was born in Brooklyn?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Joe Spinell'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'place of birth' and whose tail entity is 'Brooklyn'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Joe Spinell'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"2\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"birth name\", \"Joseph Spagnuolo\"],\n    [\"Joseph Spagnuolo\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"3\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"portrayed\", \"Willie Cicci (The Godfather)\"],\n    [\"Willie Cicci (The Godfather)\", \"portrayed by\", \"Joe Spinell\"],\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"4\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"starred\", \"James Caan\"],\n    [\"James Caan\", \"place of birth\", \"Bronx\"],\n    [\"James Caan\", \"worked with\", \"Joe Spinell\"],\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"5\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"set in\", \"New York City\"],\n    [\"Brooklyn\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"]\n  ],\n  \"6\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Maniac\"],\n    [\"Maniac\", \"filmed in\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"7\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Rocky\"],\n    [\"Rocky\", \"starred\", \"Sylvester Stallone\"],\n    [\"Sylvester Stallone\", \"place of birth\", \"New York City\"],\n    [\"Brooklyn\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"]\n  ],\n  \"8\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather Part II\"],\n    [\"The Godfather Part II\", \"starred\", \"Al Pacino\"],\n    [\"Al Pacino\", \"place of birth\", \"East Harlem\"],\n    [\"East Harlem\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"],\n    [\"Brooklyn\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"]\n  ],\n  \"9\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Taxi Driver\"],\n    [\"Taxi Driver\", \"starred\", \"Harvey Keitel\"],\n    [\"Harvey Keitel\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"10\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"directed by\", \"Francis Ford Coppola\"],\n    [\"Francis Ford Coppola\", \"father\", \"Carmine Coppola\"],\n    [\"Carmine Coppola\", \"place of birth\", \"New York City\"],\n    [\"Brooklyn\", \"located in\", \"New York City\"]\n  ],\n  \"11\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Nighthawks\"],\n    [\"Nighthawks\", \"starred\", \"Lindsay Wagner\"],\n    [\"Lindsay Wagner\", \"place of birth\", \"Los Angeles\"],\n    [\"Nighthawks\", \"filmed in\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"12\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Seven-Ups\"],\n    [\"The Seven-Ups\", \"starred\", \"Roy Scheider\"],\n    [\"Roy Scheider\", \"place of birth\", \"Orange, New Jersey\"],\n    [\"The Seven-Ups\", \"filmed in\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"13\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"starred\", \"Richard S.

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Joe Spinell'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'place of birth' and whose tail entity is 'Brooklyn'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Joe Spinell'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"guest of\", \"Joe Franklin Show\"],\n    [\"Joe Franklin Show\", \"hosted by\", \"Joe Franklin\"],\n    [\"Joe Franklin\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"2\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"cinematographer\", \"Gordon Willis\"],\n    [\"Gordon Willis\", \"place of birth\", \"Queens\"],\n    [\"Queens\", \"neighboring\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"3\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"music by\", \"Nino Rota\"],\n    [\"Nino Rota\", \"collaborated with\", \"Lenny Gatto\"],\n    [\"Lenny Gatto\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"4\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"casting director\", \"Louis DiGiaimo\"],\n    [\"Louis DiGiaimo\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"5\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"starred\", \"Gianni Russo\"],\n    [\"Gianni Russo\", \"place of birth\", \"Manhattan\"],\n    [\"Manhattan\", \"neighboring\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"6\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Night Hawks\"],\n    [\"Night Hawks\", \"starred\", \"Nigel Davenport\"],\n    [\"Nigel Davenport\", \"acted in\", \"Phase IV\"],\n    [\"Phase IV\", \"starred\", \"Michael Murphy (actor)\"],\n    [\"Michael Murphy (actor)\", \"place of birth\", \"Los Angeles\"],\n    [\"Night Hawks\", \"filmed in\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"7\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"starred\", \"Richard Bright\"],\n    [\"Richard Bright\", \"place of birth\", \"Bay Ridge\"],\n    [\"Bay Ridge\", \"located in\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"8\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather Part III\"],\n    [\"The Godfather Part III\", \"production company\", \"Zoetrope Studios\"],\n    [\"Zoetrope Studios\", \"co-founded by\", \"Francis Ford Coppola\"],\n    [\"Francis Ford Coppola\", \"mother\", \"Italia Coppola\"],\n    [\"Italia Coppola\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"9\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Maniac\"],\n    [\"Maniac\", \"special effects by\", \"Tom Savini\"],\n    [\"Tom Savini\", \"acted in\", \"The Burning\"],\n    [\"The Burning\", \"starred\", \"Jason Alexander\"],\n    [\"Jason Alexander\", \"place of birth\", \"Newark\"],\n    [\"The Burning\", \"filmed in\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"10\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"The Godfather\"],\n    [\"The Godfather\", \"starred\", \"Frank Sivero\"],\n    [\"Frank Sivero\", \"acted in\", \"Goodfellas\"],\n    [\"Goodfellas\", \"starred\", \"Lorraine Bracco\"],\n    [\"Lorraine Bracco\", \"place of birth\", \"Brooklyn\"]\n  ],\n  \"11\": [\n    [\"Joe Spinell\", \"acted in\", \"Rocky II\"],\n    [\"Rocky II\", \"starred\", \"Burgess Meredith\"],\n    [\"Burgess Meredith\", \"acted in\", \"Of Mice and Men (1939 film)\"],\n    [\"Of Mice and Men (1939 film)\", \"starred\", \"Betty Field\"],\n    [\"Betty Field\", \"spouse\", \"Edwin J.

No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Niall Horan'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Harry Styles\"],\n    [\"Harry Styles\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"2\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Louis Tomlinson\"],\n    [\"Louis Tomlinson\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"3\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Liam Payne\"],\n    [\"Liam Payne\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"4\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Zayn Malik\"],\n    [\"Zayn Malik\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"5\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"co-wrote song\", \"Story of My Life\"],\n    [\"Story of My Life\", \"performed by\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Harry Styles\"],\n    [\"Harry Styles\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"6\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"signed to\", \"Syco Music\"],\n    [\"Syco Music\", \"founded by\", \"Simon Cowell\"],\n    [\"Simon Cowell\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"7\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"has manager\", \"Modest!

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Niall Horan'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'country of citizenship' and whose tail entity is 'United Kingdom'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Niall Horan'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Harry Styles\"],\n    [\"Harry Styles\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"2\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Louis Tomlinson\"],\n    [\"Louis Tomlinson\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"3\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Liam Payne\"],\n    [\"Liam Payne\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"4\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Zayn Malik\"],\n    [\"Zayn Malik\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"5\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"co-wrote song\", \"Story of My Life\"],\n    [\"Story of My Life\", \"performed by\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Harry Styles\"],\n    [\"Harry Styles\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"6\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"signed to\", \"Syco Music\"],\n    [\"Syco Music\", \"founded by\", \"Simon Cowell\"],\n    [\"Simon Cowell\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"7\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"has manager\", \"Modest!

citizen of the United Kingdom?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Niall Horan'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'country of citizenship' and whose tail entity is 'United Kingdom'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Niall Horan'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Harry Styles\"],\n    [\"Harry Styles\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"2\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Louis Tomlinson\"],\n    [\"Louis Tomlinson\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"3\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Liam Payne\"],\n    [\"Liam Payne\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"4\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"member of\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Zayn Malik\"],\n    [\"Zayn Malik\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"5\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"co-wrote song\", \"Story of My Life\"],\n    [\"Story of My Life\", \"performed by\", \"One Direction\"],\n    [\"One Direction\", \"has member\", \"Harry Styles\"],\n    [\"Harry Styles\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"6\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"signed to\", \"Syco Music\"],\n    [\"Syco Music\", \"founded by\", \"Simon Cowell\"],\n    [\"Simon Cowell\", \"country of citizenship\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n  ],\n  \"7\": [\n    [\"Niall Horan\", \"has manager\", \"Modest!

their work?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Marlon Jackson'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'fandom' and whose tail entity is 'Michael Jackson fandom'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Marlon Jackson'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Marlon Jackson\", \"sibling\", \"Michael

ways of connecting Marlon Jackson, a member of the famous Jackson family, and someone who has a dedicated fandom surrounding their work?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Marlon Jackson'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'fandom' and whose tail entity is 'Michael Jackson fandom'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Marlon Jackson'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Marlon Jackson\", \"co-founded\", \"Motherland

Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, and someone who is known for their work as a poet?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Boutros Boutros-Ghali'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'occupation' and whose tail entity is 'poet'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Boutros Boutros-Ghali'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Boutros Boutros-Ghali\", \"predecessor\", \"Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar\"],\n    [\"Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar\", \"occupation\", \"poet\"]\n  ],\n  \"2\": [\n    [\"Boutros Boutros-Ghali\", \"successor\", \"Kofi Annan\"],\n    [\"Kofi Annan\", \"spouse\", \"Nane Maria Annan\"],\n    [\"Nane Maria Annan\", \"grandparent\", \"Raoul Wallenberg\"],\n    [\"Raoul Wallenberg\", \"subject of work\", \"Raoul Wallenberg: The Man Who Stopped Death\"],\n    [\"Raoul Wallenberg: The Man Who Stopped Death\", \"author\", \"John Bierman\"],\n    [\"John Bierman\", \"collaborated with\", \"Colin Smith\"],\n    [\"Colin Smith\", \"occupation\", \"poet\"]\n  ],\n  \"3\": [\n    [\"Boutros Boutros-Ghali\", \"alma mater\", \"University of Paris\"],\n    [\"University of Paris\", \"alumnus\", \"Paul Val\u00e9ry\"],\n    [\"Paul Val\u00e9ry\", \"occupation\", \"poet\"]\n  ],\n  \"4\": [\n    [\"Boutros Boutros-Ghali\", \"nationality\", \"Egypt\"],\n    [\"Egypt\", \"notable person\", \"Ahmed Rami (poet)\"],\n    [\"Ahmed Rami (poet)\", \"occupation\", \"poet\"]\n  ],\n  \"5\": [\n    [\"Boutros Boutros-Ghali\", \"authored\", \"Egypt's Road to Jerusalem\"],\n    [\"Egypt's Road to Jerusalem\", \"publisher\", \"Random House\"],\n    [\"Random House\", \"published\", \"The Collected Poems of W.

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Boutros Boutros-Ghali'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'occupation' and whose tail entity is 'poet'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Boutros Boutros-Ghali'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON

Leverage concept B to determine how to phrase the query.  \neg: if concept B is a person, then formulate a query such that concept C is a property for a person. eg: \"someone for whom the election was a significant event\".\nsimilarly, if concept B is an organization, using \"an organization that has...\"\nif concept B is a chemical compound\/medicine then use \"a substance that is...\"\n2. For any concept C with a familial relation, i.e. child\/mother\/father, the concept should be interpreted as \" has child <entity3>\" or \"has mother <entity 3>\" or \"has father <entity3>\".   \n3. Do not reveal concept B in the query at all. \n4. Avoid overly formal or mechanical phrasing.\n5. Do not connect concept A and C directly in the wording. \n\n---- EXAMPLES ----\nExample 1:\nConcept A: Vishwanath Pratap Singh\nConcept B: Narendra Modi (person)\nConcept C: (significant event, Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for Indian general election, 2014)   \nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Vishwanath Pratap Singh and someone for whom the BJP campaign for the 2014 Indian general election, was a significant event? \n\nExample 2: \nConcept A: Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\nConcept B: Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar (person)\nConcept C: (position held, President of the Council of Ministers of Peru) \nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, and someone who is\/has been the President of the council of ministers of Peru? \n \n Example 3: \nConcept A: Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen\nConcept B: Sebastian Vettel (person)\nConcept C: ('member of sports team', 'Red Bull Racing')\n\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Kimi Raikkonen, the Finnish racing driver and a sports person who was\/is a part of the Red Bull Racing team?\n\nExample 4: \nConcept A: Jim Broadbent\nConcept B: Saoirse Ronan (person)\nConcept C: (nominated for, Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress)\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Jim Broadbent, English actor, and someone who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress?\n\nExample 5:\nConcept A: oxymetholone\nConcept B: sodium ascorbate (substance)\nConcept C: stereoisomer of, sodium erythorbate\n\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting oxymetholone, a chemical compound and a substance that is a stereoisomer of sodium erythorbate\n\nExample 6:\nConcept A: Christopher Nolan\nConcept B: Emma Thomas (person)\nConcept C: (child, Rory Nolan)\nQuery: What are different ways of connecting Christopher Nolan, the actor, and someone who is the parent of Rory Nolan? \n \n---- TASK ---- \n\nConcept A: Richard Mentor Johnson\nConcept B: Kamala Harris (person)\nConcept C: (Kamala Harris,2016 United States Senate election in California,candidacy in election)\n\nQuery:\n","query":"What are different ways of connecting Richard Mentor Johnson, a notable political figure, and someone who had a candidacy in the 2016 United States Senate election in California?","entity_a":"Richard Mentor Johnson","entity_b":"2016 United States Senate election in California","rel_b":"candidacy in election","index":17,"prompt":[{"content":"Query: What are different ways of connecting Richard Mentor Johnson, a notable political figure, and someone who had a candidacy in the 2016 United States Senate election in California?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths.

States Senate election in California?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Richard Mentor Johnson'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'candidacy in election' and whose tail entity is '2016 United States Senate election in California'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Richard Mentor Johnson'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Richard Mentor Johnson\", \"was Vice President under\", \"Martin Van Buren\"],\n    [\"Martin Van Buren\", \"is a former President of\", \"United States\"],\n    [\"United States\", \"has state\", \"California\"],\n    [\"Kamala Harris\", \"is Attorney General of\", \"California\"],\n    [\"Kamala Harris\", \"candidacy in election\", \"2016 United States Senate election in California\"]\n  ],\n  \"2\": [\n    [\"Richard Mentor Johnson\", \"served in United States Senate with\", \"John C.

States Senate election in California?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Richard Mentor Johnson'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'candidacy in election' and whose tail entity is '2016 United States Senate election in California'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Richard Mentor Johnson'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n"],"raw_path_prediction":["<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"Richard Mentor Johnson\", \"served as Vice President during\", \"Martin Van Buren presidency\"],\n    [\"Martin Van Buren presidency\", \"preceded\", \"Abraham Lincoln presidency\"],\n    [\"Abraham Lincoln presidency\", \"took place in\", \"United States\"],\n    [\"United States\", \"includes state\", \"California\"],\n    [\"California\", \"held\", \"2016 United States Senate election in California\"],\n    [\"George C.

Concept C is a property of Concept B, which the person is supposed to guess. \nYou are trying create a query that elicits a connection between Concept A and Concept C, to see if the person being quizzed can guess concept B. \nYour goal is to create a natural, human-readable question.\nWhen needed, add a short descriptor to Concept A, especially when it is a niche entity.\n\nRules:\n1. Leverage concept B to determine how to phrase the query.  \neg: if concept B is a person, then formulate a query such that concept C is a property for a person. eg: \"someone for whom the election was a significant event\".\nsimilarly, if concept B is an organization, using \"an organization that has...\"\nif concept B is a chemical compound\/medicine then use \"a substance that is...\"\n2. For any concept C with a familial relation, i.e. child\/mother\/father, the concept should be interpreted as \" has child <entity3>\" or \"has mother <entity 3>\" or \"has father <entity3>\".   \n3. Do not reveal concept B in the query at all. \n4. Avoid overly formal or mechanical phrasing.\n5.

A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'Job R\u00f6mer'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'occupation' and whose tail entity is 'actor'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'Job R\u00f6mer'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON

physically interacts with the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'chlorpromazine'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'physically interacts with' and whose tail entity is 'Cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'chlorpromazine'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON

interacts with the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'chlorpromazine'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'physically interacts with' and whose tail entity is 'Cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'chlorpromazine'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the end condition.\n- Each triple must be of the form: (head entity, relationship, tail entity).\n- Relationship strings must be 1\u20133 words.\n- If no valid path exists, return an empty JSON object.\n\nEnumerate all distinct valid connection paths that satisfy the above constraints.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"<answer>\n{\n  \"1\": [\n    [\"chlorpromazine\", \"has pharmacological

various mental health conditions, and a substance that physically interacts with the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit?\n\nTask: Identify how two real-world entities are connected by producing MANY connection paths. A connection path is a sequence of factual triples (head, relationship, tail) forming a continuous chain that begins with one entity and ends with a required target condition.\n\nYou MUST generate as many distinct valid paths as possible. Within each individual path, prefer STRONG connections (highly exclusive, specific relationships). Across the full set of paths, maintain DIVERSITY: include both popular\/well-known connections and less well-known \u201ctrivia\u201d connections, and avoid over-concentrating on the most obvious domain (e.g., for a celebrity, do not only use their main profession\u2014add distinct non-professional connections when available).\n\nPath definition:\n- Every path MUST start with the head entity: 'chlorpromazine'\n- Every path MUST end with a triple whose relationship is 'physically interacts with' and whose tail entity is 'Cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit'\n- Paths may be direct or indirect and may include one or more intermediate entities\n\nRules and quality constraints:\n- Entities must be concrete, real-world entities only (people, organizations, works, places, genes, diseases, species, etc.). No abstract concepts.\n- Do not ask follow-up questions; respond using the best available factual knowledge.\n- Temporal connections are allowed (relationships may span different historical periods).\n- Disambiguation is required: use canonical names and qualifiers where necessary (e.g., 'Michael Jordan (basketball)').\n- If multiple canonical entities share the same name, explore ALL of them explicitly where relevant.\n\nDeduplication:\n- Do not repeat the same path.\n- Do not repeat the same triple within a single path.\n- Prefer paths that are meaningfully different (different intermediate nodes and\/or different relationships), not trivial rephrasings.\n\nCoverage & diversity:\n- Generate as many distinct valid paths as you can.\n- Explore a broad range of relationship types for 'chlorpromazine'.\n- Include BOTH:\n  (a) strong\/obvious connections (the first things most people would think of), AND\n  (b) less well-known but still factual connections (\u201ctrivia\u201d) that are distinct from the popular ones.\n- After you have produced several paths in a dominant domain (e.g., movies\/acting for an actor), actively search for other distinct domains (e.g. philanthropy) when possible.\n\nRelationship quality guidance:\n- Prefer strong, specific, and distinctive relationships.\n  - Strong = highly exclusive (e.g., parent\/child, founder-of, spouse, authored, CEO-of, member-of a small group).\n  - Weaker = shared broad attributes (e.g., \u201cattended\u201d, \u201clives in\u201d, \u201cworked on\u201d in very large productions).\n- In each individual path, prioritize strong links early in the chain when possible.\n- Across paths, start with strong + distinctive paths, then include progressively more general\/weaker but still valid paths to maximize coverage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput requirements (strict):\n- Return ONLY a JSON object wrapped in <answer> tags. Do not include any explanatory text.\n\n- The JSON object must use integer keys starting from 1.\n- Each integer key maps to a list of triples that form a continuous chain from the start entity to the
